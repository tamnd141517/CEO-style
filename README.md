# CEO-style
This project takes inspiration from the work of Malmendier and Tate (2005) who analyzed Corporate Investment and CEO overconfidence. The objective was to understand whether the managerial overconfidence is a determinant of corporate investment distortions.
<p/>"Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing." - Malmendier and Tate (2005, abstract)
<p/>Malmendier and Tate tested their "overconfidence hypothesis", that the investment of overconfident CEOs would be more responsive to cash flow than that of non-overconfident CEOs. To do this they constructed a panel data set of the personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. They classified CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk.
<p/>This project will test the overconfidence hypothesis using a different set of data. The variables included in the dataset are:
<p/>year:
Year of the observation
<p/>firmid:
A firm specific identifier
<p/>I:
Investment (%), defined as firm capital expenditures as a percentage of capital at the beginning of the year
<p/>CF:
Cash flow, defined as earnings before extraordinary items plus depreciation as a percentage of capital at the beginning of the year
<p/>MV:
Market value of assets over book value of assets at the beginning of the year (%)
<p/>S:
Percentage of total shares owned by CEO or CEO's family (%)
<p/>size:
Logarithm of assets (Â£) at the beginning of the year
<p/>CG:
Number of outside directors who are CEOs in other companies
<p/>TC:
Press based overconfidence measure, the number of articles mentioning CEO as "confident" or "optimistic"
<p/>TD:
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the majority of articles portrayed confidence and 0 otherwise
